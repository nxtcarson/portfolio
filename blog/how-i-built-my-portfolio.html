            <!-- Introduction -->
            <section class="post-section">
                <p>
                    After spending weeks learning web development through projects, we officially started web development in class where I had an assignment in my software engineering class to make a portfolio. I wanted something unique that would stand out while still showing my skills and projects.
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- Design Philosophy -->
            <section class="post-section">
                <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of making the portfolio, I picked a majority black theme with a purple accent color because purple is my favorite color and black is easier on the eyes. I added a lot of gradients and animations to make the site more interesting and just in general look cooler to me. Here's the rundown of what I wanted to achieve:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clean, minimalist layout that reserved room for actual content while still being cool looking.</li>
                    <li>Interactive elements that responded to users</li>
                    <li>Smooth animations that don't disorient viewers</li>
                    <li>A unique color scheme that is easy on the eyes</li>
                </ul>
            </section>


            <!-- Technical Implementation -->
            <section class="post-section">
                <h2>Building the Core Features</h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the more important features I implemented were:
                </p>

                <h3>1. Particle Background</h3>
                <p>
                    I used the popular and free particles.js to create the interactive background. I had to experiment a lot with the settings - at first I tried using 200 particles but it lagged so badly on my old laptop lol. After some trial and error around 2 AM (when I do my best coding ðŸ˜…), I found that 80 particles with subtle movements worked perfectly:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-javascript">
particlesJS('particles-js', {
    particles: {
        number: { value: 80 },  // Started with 200, way too much!
        color: { value: '#9c27b0' },
        opacity: {
            value: 0.5,
            random: true
        }
        // ... more configuration
    }
});</code></pre>

                <h3>2. Custom Audio Player</h3>
                <p>
                    I wanted background music but with a modern look that started off muted. Fun fact: I spent like 3 hours trying to make a fancy visualizer before giving up and going with this simpler design that actually works better:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-javascript">
// Basic audio controls - keeping it simple after the visualizer disaster
playPauseBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (bgAudio.paused) {
        bgAudio.play();
        playPauseBtn.innerHTML = '&lt;i class="fas fa-pause">&lt;/i>';
    } else {
        bgAudio.pause();
        playPauseBtn.innerHTML = '&lt;i class="fas fa-play">&lt;/i>';
    }
});</code></pre>

                <h3>3. Smooth Animations</h3>
                <p>
                    The animations are a mix of CSS and JavaScript. For card animations, I used this approach after seeing something similar on a Discord bot website (shoutout to MEE6's website for the inspiration):
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
.project-card {
    transition: transform 0.3s ease;
    animation: float 6s ease-in-out infinite;
}

@keyframes float {
    0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0); }
    50% { transform: translateY(-10px); }
}</code></pre>

                <h3>4. Tilt and Hover Effects</h3>
                <p>
                    One of my favorite features is the tilt effect on the cards. I found this cool library called Vanilla-Tilt.js while browsing the webdev subreddit at 3 AM because I was bored. After messing around with the settings for way too long, I got it working:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-javascript">
// The tilt effect in question
VanillaTilt.init(document.querySelectorAll("[data-tilt]"), {
    max: 5,       // tried 15 first, made me dizzy lol
    speed: 400,   // 1000 was WAY too slow
    glare: true,  // looks sick with the purple theme
    "max-glare": 0.2,
});</code></pre>

                <p>
                    For the hover effects on headings (like the game titles), I wanted something subtle and smooth. After trying different things, I settled on this clean underline animation:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="language-css">
/* The hover bar effect I saw everywhere on the internet */

h4::after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    bottom: -5px;  /* -2px was too close, -8px was too far */
    width: 0;
    height: 2px;
    background: var(--accent-color);
    transition: width 0.3s ease;
}

h4:hover::after {
    width: 100%;
}</code></pre>

                <p>
                    Getting this to work with the particle background was a pain because of z-index issues. Spent a whole evening debugging why the hover effect was appearing behind everything else. But I just needed to add position: relative to the parent element.
                </p>

            <!-- Challenges and Solutions -->
            <section class="post-section">
                <h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>
                <p>
                    Building this portfolio was unnecessarily hard, mostly because I kept trying to add "one more cool feature" at 2 AM. Here are some problems I encountered and how I eventually solved them:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The particle effect caused bad performance on mobile. I reduced the particle count and made them slower after my friend's phone nearly melted trying to load 200 particles.</li>
                    <li>Getting the custom cursor to mesh with the rest of the site was a pain. I ended up using a follower effect with a small delay after watching way too many cursor effect tutorials.</li>
                    <li>The audio player was a journey - first tried building a full visualizer (fail), then a spectrum analyzer (another fail), finally just went with a simple player that actually works.</li>
                    <li>The tilt effect initially made everything look like it was having a seizure because I set the max tilt to 25 degrees. Had to tone it down A LOT.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>


            <!-- Future Improvements -->
            <section class="post-section">
                <h2>What's Next?</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm very happy with how it turned out, but there were things I would change, and probably will soon:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adding more interactive project previews</li>
                    <li>Dark/light theme toggle</li>
                    <li>Creating more dynamic content sections</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Conclusion -->
            <section class="post-section">
                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    Building this portfolio has been very fun. It allowed me to finally implement the things that I've been seeing on so many websites throughout my life on the internet. I'm proud to say that I have successfully emulated the websites for services that I admired years ago.
